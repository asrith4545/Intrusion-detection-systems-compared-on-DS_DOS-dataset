These are the steps to run the project or to view it.

Step 1: Load the Dataset:
1.	Ensure the dataset used in the notebook is available on your local system. You can download the dataset from kaggle using this link:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/williamson5/nsl-kdd-dataset
2.	The dataset should be uploaded manually to the Colab environment before running the relevant code cells.

Step 2: Upload the .ipynb File to Google Colab
Steps to upload and run the notebook:
1.	Go to Google Colab
2.	Click on File → Upload Notebook
3.	Select the downloaded .ipynb file from your computer.
4.	Once the notebook opens, click on Runtime → Run All to execute the code.
5.	If prompted for file uploads (like the dataset), follow the instructions in the notebook to upload.

Step 3 (Optional): Run Locally Using Jupyter Notebook
If you prefer running the project locally:
1.	Install Jupyter Notebook (if not already installed) using pip: pip install notebook
2.	Launch Jupyter Notebook.
3.	Open the downloaded ipynb file in the browser interface.
4.	Download the dataset from the link.
5.	Make sure the dataset is in the same directory (or update the path in the notebook).
6.	Run the code cells as needed.
